          2.We begin by identifying the sample of all available firm-years in
          our dataset with both current and lagged earnings data reported during
          2001 to 2010. Next, we identify the k nearest neighbors – i.e., the k
          firm-years in this sample that are the closest match to firm i in
          terms of current and lagged earnings. Finally, we set our forecast of
          firm ’ earnings in 2012 equal to the the median of the nearest
          neighbors’ lead earnings.3
