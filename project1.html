          Welcome to my project where I work with the KNN algortimh to forcast
          company's earnings.

          I have been studying machine learning and my first project involves
          using the Knn algorithm to forecast a company's annual earnings. My
          goal is to predict a company's earnings based on the earnings of other
          companies with a similar financial history. I have used this article -

            href="https://www.uts.edu.au/sites/default/files/2021-01/Forecasting%20Earnings%20Using%20k-Nearest%20Neighbor%20Matching.pdf"

            Forecasting Earnings Using k-Nearest Neighbor Matching

          and this course -

          for guidance on feature selection, dataset construction, and model
          logic.

          Quote: We begin by identifying the sample of all available firm-years
          in our dataset with both current and lagged earnings data reported
          during 2009 to 2011. Next, we identify the k nearest neighbors - i.e.,
          the k firm-years in this sample that are the closest match to firm i
          in terms of current and lagged earnings. Finally, we set our forecast
          of firm's earnings in 2012 equal to the the median of the nearest
          neighbors' lead earnings.
